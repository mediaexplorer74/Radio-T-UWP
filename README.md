## My use case (user story/ scenario of using)
1. At home (or at public sace with free Wi-Fi) I opened app, then I choose and "catch" (cached) 2-hour Radio-T's "podcast item" (simply started listening process) 
2. Then I turned off WIFI and go out form home , etc. and switched the screen off :)
3. Profit (no sim cards, no power consumptions) , hehe!
